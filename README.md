Sprint 03 Reflection
UNA CSIS CAPSTONE JOBIE SCRUM TEAM DELTA

Task: Clean up uploads Problem: Multiple pages link to the same database and pulled into upload file

Requirements: A JOBIE user with an established account & logged into the system. Web browser. Access to http://buildingthepride.com/jobie/uploads/ and JOBIE database and pull files.

Design: web_info

Implementation: Tried to find out if files were pulling from a database. Found that code was made to send to an upload file. To clean up upload file, we will have to clean the code and make new files, linking documents to be downloaded into those new specific files; review and final upload.

Evaluated Solution: Did not find solution in time for group to implement and fully test for an outcome
